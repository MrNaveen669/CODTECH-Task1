# Project Overview:
This project is a simple yet functional password strength checker web application. It allows users to input a password and receive real-time feedback on the strength of the password based on length, complexity, and uniqueness. The application aims to help users create secure passwords.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the web page, including the strength bar and feedback sections.
JavaScript: For implementing the password strength evaluation logic and dynamically updating the UI.

# Features:
Password Strength Feedback:Users receive detailed feedback about their password's length, complexity, and uniqueness.
Suggestions are provided to improve weak passwords.

Real-Time Strength Bar: A visual strength bar dynamically adjusts its width and color based on the password's overall strength (e.g., weak, medium, strong).

Detailed Criteria Breakdown:Feedback includes information about password length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and avoidance of common patterns.
